# PythonHelper
A Collection of Python Modules that I created in order to improve development. Most notably is my files module, which is designed to make file management much simpler for small projects

This is designed to be installed as a submodule

An example install command would be: 
```cmd
git submodule add https://github.com/S1rDev10us/PythonHelper.git
```




An example of the files module would be this:
```py
import PythonHelper
```
